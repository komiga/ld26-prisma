TODO

World:
-	need to hint to Sentient.Bucket:render
	(and Sentient.Unit:render) the tile beneath

-	Hot loading. Data is going to take up too much
	memory. Remember to cache worlds if the player
	is able to switch worlds within a session.

-	Considerations for player position if world
	jumping is used. (well, just do it anyways)

Sentient:
-	Path? Type? What sort of traits?

Trigger:

Sink:
-	has-a Sentient. (for why?)
-	merge-able to Trigger? (most likely)
