## General

-	Merge shared code back to LÃ–VE kernel.


## LD (FIXME: cleanup)

-	No tris? Lose color channels when activating sinks?
	Sink circuits take one channel each, combine at
	end of sequence?

Asset:
-	sound.player_no_drop_channel:
	error effect when player tries to drop last color
	channel into sink

World:
-	Quick decay on world change?
	All tiles decrease in size to center?
	Just player?

Presenter:
-	Split message to fit window.

Trigger:
-	Recolor: change entire zones/colors to
	another color. includes color inversion and
	color-accept inversion.

-	Decay: black plague! cannot encroach white
	tiles.

-	Sink: circuitry trigger; multiple circuit inputs;
	only activates when required tri mix is placed
	on the trigger. use seq of lines to render circuit
	path. deactivate active circuits if all tiles in
	the circuit path are not uniform in color.
	use tri to indicate current color, Black by default.
