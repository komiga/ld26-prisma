**Prisma** is a color-component-based puzzler built over a 72-hour
timeperiod for Ludum Dare #26.

## But I just want to play it!

Then you are probably looking for the [Ludum Dare entry page]
(http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=14542).

## Where are the assets?

In a git submodule. You can find the repo [here on GitHub]
(https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma-assets) if you just want to
poke around.
